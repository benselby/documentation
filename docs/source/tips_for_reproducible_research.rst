Tips for Reproducible Research
==============================

`Go to Erin's Lab meeting slide for on this
topic <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XhfGayWVvSP9IfOl-6UOyYEhznlx286NkwuP1sxTjBU/edit?usp=sharing>`__

Here are some links to useful tutorial sites on the topic

Using Git
---------

We have a very basic overview of how to `use git
here <https://github.com/TIGRLab/documentation/wiki/Using-Git>`__.

Jenny Bryan's Happy Git with R book is a super comprehensive book (still
in draft form) that details how to use git for an R analysis project
using the helper tools in rstudio. (`find it
here <http://happygitwithr.com/>`__)

For organising a python based analysis project. Check out this repo for
tips (https://github.com/uwescience/shablona)

Linking files
-------------

One way to cut down on the size of use of hard disk space, and to keep a
nicer record of where your data is coming from is to create symbolic
links instead of copying files. Here's some extra information on how to
do that.

-  this `Youtube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va4CedGgGo8>`__
-  this `online
   tutorial <https://www.nixtutor.com/freebsd/understanding-symbolic-links/>`__
-  ``lndir`` (`man page here <https://linux.die.net/man/1/lndir>`__)
   will let you create a "shadow" directory tree made entirely of
   symbolic links

BIDS and BIDS apps
------------------

These papers do an excellent job of explaining the motivation behind
these and how to use them.
