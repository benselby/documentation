As a new lab member here are the first things you should do to get settled in to the lab:

- [ ] **Get a lab account:** Talk to an admin (Dawn) and get a lab account set up so you can use all of our workstations.

- [ ] **Request access to the kimel-lab mailing list:** send an email to kimel-lab-join@info2.camh.net to be automatically enrolled. We use this mailing list to send important lab notices and to share interesting papers, upcoming deadlines, etc. Everyone in the lab should have access.

- [ ] **Create a [GitHub account](http://github.com) and send your username to tigrlab@camh.ca.** This account is needed to add you to our GitHub organization and gives you access to our [issue tracker](#issue-tracker), where you can request help and report problems, and to our QC dashboard. It also gives you access to any private repositories we might have and allows you to add your own repositories if you work on any code for the lab.

- [ ] **Get access to our slack channel**. Talk to a lab member and ask for an invite! This one is optional, but we use our slack to organize lab outings and just generally chat / ask each other questions so you'll be out of the loop without it.

- [ ] **Get access to our lab calendar**. We use our calendar to let everyone know when we'll be away on vacation or at conferences, and to note down important meetings. [This page](https://github.com/TIGRLab/documentation/wiki/Lab-Calendar) has info on how to get access.

- [ ] **Browse through the rest of this wiki!** Not all pages on the wiki are relevant to everyone, or relevant right when you start, but there is a lot scattered throughout its pages that will help acclimate you to the lab. Once you have your GitHub account, you may add/edit pages (please do!). Also please let us know if you see room for improvement in our wiki as you read through it.
